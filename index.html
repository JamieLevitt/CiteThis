<h2 id="2-data-collection-and-use">2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post Text Processing:</strong> When you view a post, the Extension extracts the post&#39;s text and sends it to our designated API endpoint solely for analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Processing:</strong> The post text is processed by Python functions running internally. All content is processed in memory, and no data is stored, saved, or sent to any external service during or after processing.</li>
<li><strong>No Personal Data Storage:</strong> No personally identifiable information or additional user data is collected or stored beyond what is necessary for processing the post text. The processed results are returned to your browser and displayed without linking to your identity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-data-security">3. Data Security</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Processing:</strong> All data transmissions between your browser and our API use secure protocols (HTTPS).</li>
<li><strong>Ephemeral Handling:</strong> The post text is held temporarily in memory during processing and is immediately discarded afterward. No logs or backups are maintained that include your post text.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-third-party-disclosure">4. Third-Party Disclosure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Sharing with Third Parties:</strong> We do not share, sell, or transfer any post text or any processed data to third parties. All processing occurs within our internal systems.</li>
<li><strong>API Endpoint:</strong> The API endpoint is operated solely for the purpose of providing the analysis feature and is secured to ensure that your data is not misused.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-data-retention">5. Data Retention</h2>

<li>The Extension does not retain or save any post text or related data. All information is processed in real time and discarded immediately after the result is returned.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-user-rights">6. User Rights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> You have the right to understand what data is processed by the Extension.</li>

<p>This policy is intended to provide clear and concise information about our data handling practices. It confirms that after a post&#39;s text is sent to the API, all processing is done internally using Python functions, no data is stored or transmitted elsewhere, and only the necessary processed results are returned for display.</p>
